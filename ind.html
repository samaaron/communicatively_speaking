          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>I am fascinated with the concept of communicative programming and as such am interested in the aesthetics of programming languages, domain specific languages and language oriented programming. </p>
          <p>I believe that the pursuit of conceptual efficiency is at least as important as computational efficiency.</p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about working in small teams of smart, motivated people. I treat my work as a craft,
            and seek opportunities to learn, develop and share skills with others. I believe in the value of
            open source software, and aim to make significant contributions to such projects.
          </p>

          <p>I see software primarily as a form of communication that is not just limited to a conversation between a programmer and the computer but between many participants all of whom have an interest in understanding parts of the software.</p>
          <p>I'm inspired to improve our ability to communicate, providing people with greater freedom to express themselves in order to collaborate and share their ideas together.</p>
