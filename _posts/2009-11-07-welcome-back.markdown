For those that have noticed the recent lull in postings, you will be
pleased to hear that a normal service will be resumed shortly. I've been very
busy working hard on a number of interesting projects that I'm looking
forward very much to start talking about.

The theme of this blog will also focus more on my research interests,
namely matters concerned with _Communicative Programming_ - seeing programming
as a form of communication. Therefore I'll be using this space to
explore my ideas on concepts such _Domain Specific Languages_, _Polyglot
Programming_, _Conceptual Efficiency_, and important notions such as
perspective, intention context and time.
