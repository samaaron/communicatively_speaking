As some of you may know, Susanna, my wife, has recently started a
Ph.D. in Bioethics at Cambridge in the [Centre For Family
Research][4]. I'm so wonderfully proud of her and
it's fantastic to see her applying her mind to something that's both
interesting and challenging for her, yet ultimately valuable for us
all as a society in times ravaged by technological progress. However,
it was very difficult to deal with the fact that we would be reduced
to fleeting weekend visits; islands of togetherness in a silent ocean
of isolation.

So very luckily, [Innovation Factory][1] the company I work for,
are fantastically understanding about this and have agreed to let me
work remotely one week a month from Cambridge. I really feel proud to
have such caring colleagues to support me with this arrangement.

All of this means I spent last week living and working back in England
from the (then remarkably pleasant) climes of Cambridge.

I have only ever briefly visited Cambridge before this stay, so only
managed to get a glimpse of the condensed beauty it offers. Even
compared to Amsterdam it is a tiny city, and like Amsterdam it offers
wonderful architecture, a rich cultural history and an affinity for
cycling. Although don't get your hopes up too much - this is still
strictly an English city and it's cycling offerings are only
relatively better than other English offerings - [all of which pale in
comparison][2] to the [facilities here in the Netherlands][3].

However, what I hadn't experienced until last week's visit were the
people Cambridge attracts. Having trained as an academic, I have
certainly met my fair share of interesting people endeavouring in a
wide range of exciting studies. Cambridge has a wealth of such
endeavours. Yet, what sets those I met in Cambridge apart is that they're not only
_interesting_, they're _interested_. I have some strange and obscure ideas
about the communication of process especially when I apply them to the
context of music, yet I found no shortage of people readily wanting to
listen and discuss them with me. I found this overwhelmingly
powerful. Here there were people not only capable of working in their
own field but also free and willing to explore other areas and able to
combine and contrast concepts from wildly different contexts.

I'm really looking forward to my next visit and if anyone reading this
happens to also be in Cambridge, I'd love to meet you for a coffee one
morning.
