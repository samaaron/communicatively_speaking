For those that have noticed the recent lull in postings, you will be
pleased to hear that a normal service will shortly be resumed. I've been very
busy working hard on a number of interesting projects that I'm looking
forward to sharing with everyone.

The theme of this blog will also focus more on my research interests,
namely matters concerned with _Communicative Programming_ - seeing programming
as a form of communication. Therefore I'll be using this space to
explore my ideas on concepts such as _Domain Specific Languages_, _Polyglot
Programming_, _Conceptual Efficiency_, and important notions such as
perspective, intention context and time.

You might also note that this blog no longer contains a comments
form. This is partly due to technical reasons and mostly due to the
huge personal benefits I gain by not having to deal with spam filters
and all that paraphernalia. The technical aspects are down to me
choosing a static site generator tool ([Jekyll][1] in this case) which
allows me to completely bypass any web site authentication and interfaces, and
focus purely on writing text in [Markdown][4] with [Emacs][2] and pushing updates with [Git][3]. Things
like this really soothe my mind.


I'm really looking forward to getting some more of my ideas out and
sharing them with you all. Although there is no comment form, I will
be accepting comments via email and if I think they're helpful and relevant will happily append them to the post they're
related to. Hopefully the small amount of effort of emailing a comment
will help to increase each comment's quality - a win for everyone!

See you back here soon...
